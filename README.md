# A1Evo_MJ_Custom

This is a custom version of the A1 evo maestro MJ script that I have built for my personal use.

It's based on OCA's original work here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmZ5yV1-wMI

The differences between custom and the regular version are documented here - https://www.avsforum.com/threads/a1evo-mj-custom.3325897/
